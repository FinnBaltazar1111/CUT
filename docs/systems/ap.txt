[DESC]An explination of the ChromeOS boot system from CPU init to kernel loading[UNDESC]

[SECTION]Section 1 - Overview[UNSECTION]

  When a Chromebook boots up, the first action performed depends on which security software is being utilized. [RED]If a
  TI50 is used, the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE], before [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] load, will verify the RO
  [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] if [UNDERLINE]FWMP[UNDERLINE] is set. If this verification fails, the GSC will hold the EC
  in reset, effectively bricking the system, requiring a [UNDERLINE]SuzyQ[NOUNDERLINE] or external EEPROM flasher like a
  CH341A to recover.[WHITE] For unknown reasons, this check only seems to run on GSC reset, which only occurs if the
  system completely looses power.
  
  If the system uses another security chip (or the RO [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] verification passes/doesn't run), the
  CPU will load the code from the AP and execute it. From here, the AP loads Coreboot, which handles hardware
  initialization before chainloading [UNDERLINE]VBoot[NOUNDERLINE]. [UNDERLINE]VBoot[NOUNDERLINE] first checks if the
  [UNDERLINE]Recovery[NOUNDERLINE] switch is set and continues accordingly.  Continuing in normal boot, it verifies the
  RW region of the firmware[1], then, if it's valid, it continues on to loading the region. RW then checks if the
  [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE] switch is set; if it is, then it continues on to [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE],
  otherwise it continues to [UNDERLINE]Verified[NOUNDERLINE].

    1. Find all ChromeOS kernel partitions
    2. Sort them by kernel priority
    3. Check the first kernel's signing against the public key
    4. Compares the kernel's kernver with the GSC's 5. Loads [UNDERLINE]Depthcharge[NOUNDERLINE] pointing at the kernel's
    partition
    
    If steps 3 or 4 fail, it cascades verification attempts in order of priority until either the end of the list is
    reached or a kernel can be loaded.
  
  - [SUBSECTION]Recovery[NOSUBSECTION]
    
    Waits until a USB drive is inserted, then verifies the kernel on the USB against the signing key stored in the RO;
    if the key matches, the AP loads Depthcharge pointing at the kernel on the USB. The firmware does not compare the
    kernvers. If recovery is triggered while [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE] mode is active, the
    [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE], [UNDERLINE]KERNVER[NOUNDERLINE], and TPM_FWVER regions are protected from writes[1].
    Contrary to popular belief, [BOLD]RMA Shims don't have a special underlying signing key[UNBOLD]. The AP actually
    does something quite strange here, as, while the underlying signing key is the same, the key actually used to sign
    the shim also contains a configuration option that specifies it as a shim.
  
  - [SUBSECTION]Developer[NOSUBSECTION]
    
    Upon loading, [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] status is checked; if it's set, the firmware will refuse to load any
    other payloads and will show debugging information. There are 3 payload options from here:
      - (CTRL+U) Depthcharge (SSD): Loads Depthcharge pointing at the internal storage, skipping the validity check
        (unless dev_boot_signed_only=1)
      - (CTRL+D) Depthcharge (USB): Ditto, but with Depthcharge pointing at the USB controller
      - (CTRL+L) RW_Legacy: Jumps to the start of the RW_Legacy coreboot filesystem (Mr. Chromebox's FW_Legacy script
        modifies this)

[1] - This protection was added in CR50 update <UNKNOWN>, shipped on ChromeOS v111 and higher
