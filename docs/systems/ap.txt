[TITLE]AP[UNTITLE]
[DESC]An explination of the ChromeOS boot system from CPU init to kernel loading[UNDESC]

[SECTION]Section 1 - Overview[UNSECTION]
  When a Chromebook boots up, the first action performed depends on which security software is being utilized. [RED]If a
  TI50 is used, the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE], before [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] load, will verify the RO
  [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] if [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is set. If this verification fails, the GSC will hold the EC
  in reset, effectively bricking the system, requiring a [UNDERLINE]SuzyQ[NOUNDERLINE] or external EEPROM flasher like a
  CH341A to recover.[WHITE] For unknown reasons, this check only seems to run on GSC reset, which only occurs if the
  system completely looses power.

  From here, the AP loads Coreboot, which handles hardware initialization before chainloading [UNDERLINE]VBoot[NOUNDERLINE].
  [UNDERLINE]VBoot[NOUNDERLINE] first checks if the [UNDERLINE]Recovery[NOUNDERLINE] switch is set and continues accordingly.  
  Continuing in normal boot, it verifies the RW region of itself[1], then, if it's valid, it continues on to loading the region.
  RW then checks if the [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE] switch is set; if it is, then it continues on to [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE],
  otherwise it continues to [UNDERLINE]Verified[NOUNDERLINE].

    1. Find all ChromeOS kernel partitions
    2. Sort them by kernel priority
    3. Check the first kernel's signing against the public key
    4. Compares the kernel's kernver with the GSC's
    5. Loads Depthcharge pointing at the kernel's partition
    If steps 3 or 4 fail, it cascades verification attempts in order of priority until either the end of the list is
      reached or a kernel can be loaded.
  - [SUBSECTION]Recovery[NOSUBSECTION]
    Waits until a USB drive is inserted, then verifies the kernel on the USB against the signing key stored in the RO;
      if the key matches, the AP loads Depthcharge pointing at the kernel on the USB.
    The firmware does not compare the kernvers.
    If recovery is triggered while [UNDERLINE]Developer[NOUNDERLINE] mode is active, [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is set to
      read-only[1]
    Contrary to popular belief, [RED]RMA Shims don't have a special underlying signing key[WHITE]
    The AP actually does something quite strange here, as, while the underlying signing key is the same,
      the key actually used to sign the shim also contains a configuration option that specifies it as a shim.
    
  - [SUBSECTION]Developer[NOSUBSECTION]
    Upon loading, [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] status is checked; if it's set, the firmware will refuse to load any other payloads and will
    show debugging information.
    There are 3 payload options from here:
      - (CTRL+D) Depthcharge (SSD): Loads Depthcharge pointing at the internal storage, skipping the validity check (unless dev_boot_signed_only=1)
      - (CTRL+U) Depthcharge (USB): Ditto, but with Depthcharge pointing at the USB controller
      - (CTRL+L) RW_Legacy: Jumps to the start of the RW_Legacy coreboot filesystem (Mr. Chromebox's FW_Legacy script modifies this)

[1] - This protection was added in CR50 update <UNKNOWN>, shipped on ChromeOS v111 and higher
