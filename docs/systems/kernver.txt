[DESC]A description of kernel max rollback versions (kernvers) and the exploits available for them[UNDESC]

[SECTION]Section 1 - Technical overview[UNSECTION]
The kernel version rollback protection system, referred to as the kernver in the [UNDERLINE]Firmware[NOUNDERLINE],
is a 4-byte section of memory in the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE] that is used to determine the minimum signed
ChromeOS version that can be loaded.
[PURPLE]TL;DR it's Google's system to prevent downgrading to utilize critical exploits.[WHITE]

[SECTION]Section 2 - Kernvers and exploits[UNSECTION]
The folowing is a list of kernel versions, their minimum downgrade version, and the associated exploits, respectively.
If a ChromeOS version is prefaced with a 'v', the listed ChromeOS version is vulnurable to that exploit, as well as any below it.
