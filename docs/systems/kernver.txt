[TITLE]Kernel Versions[UNTITLE]
[DESC]A description of kernel max rollback versions (kernvers) and the exploits available for them[UNDESC]

[SECTION]Section 1 - Technical overview[UNSECTION]

The kernel version rollback protection system, referred to as the kernver in the [UNDERLINE]Firmware[NOUNDERLINE], is a
4-byte section of memory in the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE] that is used to determine the minimum signed ChromeOS
version that can be loaded. [PURPLE]TL;DR it's Google's system to prevent downgrading to utilize critical
exploits.[WHITE]

[SECTION]Section 2 - Kernvers and exploits[UNSECTION]

The folowing is a list of kernel versions, their minimum downgrade version, and the associated exploits, respectively.
If a ChromeOS version is prefaced with a 'v', the listed ChromeOS version is vulnurable to that exploit, as well as any
below it. If an exploit is coloured red, then it's not publicly released.
