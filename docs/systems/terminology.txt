[DESC]A guide to common ChromeOS hacking systems and terminology[UNDESC]
[SECTION]Section 1 - Basic systems[UNSECTION]

[SUBSECTION]Partition[NOSUBSECTION]

  A disk is separated into multiple parts, or partitions; each one usually contains a filesystem, but not always 

[SUBSECTION]AP[NOSUBSECTION] (Application Processor)

    The AP is the chip that stores the firmware, typically [UNDERLINE]Coreboot[NOUNDERLINE].
  - Loads and bootstraps the ChromeOS system
  - Separated into read-only (RO) and read-write (RW) sections; the GSC protects the RO section from being written to
    unless the [UNDERLINE]Hardware WP[NOUNDERLINE] is disabled 
  - The code on the chip and the chip itself are often reffered to interchangably as "AP"
  - On CR50 boards, the write-protection on the RO region cannot be disabled without hardware modification or
    [UNDERLINE]CCD[NOUNDERLINE] (see [UNDERLINE]Titan-C vs CR50 vs TI50[NOUNDERLINE])

[SUBSECTION]Coreboot[NOSUBSECTION]

  Coreboot is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) firmware platform that handles hardware initialization and executes specific
  payload; in the case of Chromebooks, this payload is almost always [UNDERLINE]VBoot[NOUNDERLINE].

[SUBSECTION]VBoot[NOSUBSECTION] (Verified Boot)

Coreboot payload that handles ChromeOS intial security checks and kernel loading.

[SUBSECTION]Depthcharge[NOSUBSECTION]

  ChromeOS' bootloader
  - Stored in the RO firmware
  - Verifies and loads ChromeOS kernel images according to the configuration given and options passed.
  - The configuration in question is stored in an unknown format[1] on the kernel's partition.

[SUBSECTION]Rootfs[NOSUBSECTION]

- The actual system of ChromeOS; stores all executed programs
  - Read-only
  - Verified on boot by the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE]
  - 2 partitions for ChromeOS' update scheme ROOT A is in use most of the time, but when the device updates, the update
    is written to ROOT B. When the device next restarts, it loads ROOT B, which then updates ROOT A This is all to
    facilitate a fairly seamless update experience, as well as providing failsafes.
  
[SUBSECTION]Verified mode[NOSUBSECTION]

  Also known as normal boot mode
  - Depthcharge verifies all kernels loaded
  - If a kernel (or the [UNDERLINE]rootfs[NOUNDERLINE] that kernel loads) fails verification, this mode displays the
    "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen

[SUBSECTION]Recovery mode[NOSUBSECTION]

  - Used to restore critical ChromeOS system files in the event that a system becomes unbootable
  - In normal (verified) boot mode, [UNDERLINE]recovery images[NOUNDERLINE] will fail on the verification step if their
    kernver is lower than the system's
  - Utilizes a chain of trust starting with [UNDERLINE]Depthcharge[NOUNDERLINE] verifying the
    [UNDERLINE]Kernel[NOUNDERLINE], which then verifies the in-built [UNDERLINE]ROOTFS [NOUNDERLINE]

[SUBSECTION]Developer mode[NOSUBSECTION]

  - Permits booting of unsigned operating systems, taking TPM ownership, and writing to the
    [UNDERLINE]firmware[NOUNDERLINE]
  - If [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is set, this can only load recovery media FWMP being set is also known as "fake dev
    mode" (although this is a misnomer, see [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE]) Throughout this guide, dev mode is assumed to
    mean that [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is enabled, while NOFWMP dev mode means the opposite

[SUBSECTION]Recovery image[NOSUBSECTION] (TODO)

[SUBSECTION]Stateful[NOSUBSECTION]

  - Stores the [UNDERLINE]Encstateful[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Largest partition on the disk
  - Stores various OS info

[SUBSECTION]VPD[NOSUBSECTION] (Vital Product Data)

  - Stored in the RO section of the [UNDERLINE]Firmware[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Stores data that uniquely identifies a device, as well as some flags such as block_devmode (note: these work in
    conjunction with FWMP)
  - Contains the serial number, MAC address, and

[SUBSECTION]CCD[NOSUBSECTION] (Closed-Case Debug)
  
  A set of developer tools that can be utilized when [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is not set, permitting various actions
  that would normally require hardware modification by using a specific USB-C cable. The main features are permitting
  for disabling [UNDERLINE]AP[NOUNDERLINE] RO WP and updating the RW region of the CR50.

[SECTION]Section 2 - Security systems[UNSECTION]

[SUBSECTION]FWMP[NOSUBSECTION] (Firmware Management Parameters)

  - For the purposes of this documentation, [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] refers specifically to the block_devmode flag
    being set, as that's what almost everyone means when they say "FWMP is set"
  - Stored on the TPM
  - Dictates whether [UNDERLINE]NOFWMP dev mode[NOUNDERLINE] can be loaded
  - Cannot be set while booted in [UNDERLINE]Recovery mode[NOUNDERLINE] while [UNDERLINE]Developer mode[NOUNDERLINE] is
    enabled; aka RMA shims

[SUBSECTION]Kenver[NOSUBSECTION]

  Also known as kernel version
  - Google's response to downgrading
  - Depthcharge refuses to load any ChromeOS kernel in [UNDERLINE]Verified boot mode[NOUNDERLINE] unless the
    DISABLE_FW_ROLLBACK_CHECK [UNDERLINE]GBB[NOUNDERLINE] flag is set.

[SUBSECTION]Encstateful[NOSUBSECTION] (encrypted stateful)

  - Main storage partition; any user-edited files are stored here
  - Stores enrollment information

[SUBSECTION]GSC[NOSUBSECTION] (Google Security Chip)

  AKA TPM; chip on the motherboard that runs the CR50/TI48/TI50 software stack 
  - Stores [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Stores the decryption key for the [UNDERLINE]Encstateful[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Wiped on entering and exiting [UNDERLINE]Developer mode[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Set to read-only when booting while booting [UNDERLINE]Recovery mode[NOUNDERLINE] while [UNDERLINE]Developer
    mode[NOUNDERLINE] is enabled This applies to booting [UNDERLINE]RMA shims[NOUNDERLINE], as well as unverified
    recovery images (as [UNDERLINE]recovery images[NOUNDERLINE] loaded in developer mode will not check if their
    [UNDERLINE]kernver[NOUNDERLINE] is lower than that of the system)
  - Controls OS access to the [UNDERLINE]Firmware[NOUNDERLINE]

[SUBSECTION]Hardware WP[UNSECTION]

  A hardware condition that tells the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE] to disallow writes to the RO
  [UNDERLINE]Firmware[NOUNDERLINE] If [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is set, this condition is ignored and the RO firmware
  is protected regardless Depending on the device, this can be disabled by:
    - Unscrewing a specific screw on the motherboard
    - Unplugging the battery
    - Bridging 2 pins on the motherboard See https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html for more info
