[DESC]A guide to common ChromeOS hacking systems and terminology[UNDESC]
[SECTION]Section 1 - Basic systems[UNSECTION]

- [SUBSECTION]Partition[NOSUBSECTION]
  A disk is separated into multiple parts, or partitions; each one usually contains a filesystem, but not always 

- [SUBSECTION]Firmware[NOSUBSECTION]
  - First code run by the AP (commonly known as the CPU)
  - Loads and bootstraps the ChromeOS system

- [SUBSECTION]FWMP[NOSUBSECTION] (Firmware Management Parameters)
  - For the purposes of this documentation, [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] refers specifically to the
  block_devmode flag being set, as that's what almost everyone means when they say "FWMP is set"
  - Stored on the TPM
  - Dictates whether [UNDERLINE]NOFWMP dev mode[NOUNDERLINE] can be loaded
  - Cannot be set while booted in [UNDERLINE]Recovery mode[NOUNDERLINE] while [UNDERLINE]Developer mode[NOUNDERLINE] is enabled; aka RMA shims

- [SUBSECTION]Rootfs[NOSUBSECTION]
  - The actual system of ChromeOS; stores all executed programs
  - Read-only
  - Verified on boot by the [UNDERLINE]GSC[NOUNDERLINE]
  - 2 partitions for ChromeOS' update scheme
    ROOT A is in use most of the time, but when the device updates, the update is written to ROOT B.
    When the device next restarts, it loads ROOT B, which then updates ROOT A
    This is all to facilitate a fairly seamless update experience, as well as providing failsafes

- [SUBSECTION]Verified mode[NOSUBSECTION]
  Also known as normal boot mode
  - Depthcharge verifies all kernels loaded
  - If a kernel (or the [UNDERLINE]rootfs[NOUNDERLINE] that kernel loads) fails verification, this mode displays the "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen

- [SUBSECTION]Recovery mode[NOSUBSECTION]
  - Used to restore critical ChromeOS system files in the event that a system becomes unbootable
  - In normal (verified) boot mode, [UNDERLINE]recovery images[NOUNDERLINE] will fail on the verification step if their kernver is lower than the system's
  - Utilizes a chain of trust starting with [UNDERLINE]Depthcharge[NOUNDERLINE] verifying the [UNDERLINE]Kernel[NOUNDERLINE], which then verifies the in-built [UNDERLINE]ROOTFS [NOUNDERLINE]

- [SUBSECTION]Developer mode[NOSUBSECTION]
  - Permits booting of unsigned operating systems, taking TPM ownership, and writing to the [UNDERLINE]firmware[NOUNDERLINE]
  - If [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is set, this can only load recovery media
    FWMP being set is also known as "fake dev mode" (although this is a misnomer, see [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE])
    Throughout this guide, dev mode is assumed to mean that [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE] is enabled, while NOFWMP dev mode means the opposite

- [SUBSECTION]Recovery image[NOSUBSECTION] (TODO)

- [SUBSECTION]Kenver[NOSUBSECTION]
  Also known as kernel version
  - Google's response to downgrading
  - Depthcharge refuses to load any ChromeOS kernel in [UNDERLINE]Verified boot mode[NOUNDERLINE] unless the DISABLE_FW_ROLLBACK_CHECK [UNDERLINE]GBB[NOUNDERLINE] flag is set.

- [SUBSECTION]Stateful[NOSUBSECTION]
  - Stores the [UNDERLINE]Encstateful[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Largest partition on the disk
  - Stores various OS info

- [SUBSECTION]Encstateful[NOSUBSECTION] (encrypted stateful)
  - Main storage partition; any user-edited files are stored here
  - Stores enrollment information

- [SUBSECTION]GSC[NOSUBSECTION] (Google Security Chip)
  AKA CR50/TI48/TI50 or TPM
  - Performs [UNDERLINE]Kernel[NOUNDERLINE] verification
  - Stores [UNDERLINE]FWMP[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Stores the decryption key for the [UNDERLINE]Encstateful[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Wiped on entering and exiting [UNDERLINE]Developer mode[NOUNDERLINE]
  - Set to read-only when booting while booting [UNDERLINE]Recovery mode[NOUNDERLINE] while [UNDERLINE]Developer mode[NOUNDERLINE] is enabled
    This applies to booting [UNDERLINE]RMA shims[NOUNDERLINE], as well as unverified recovery images
      (as [UNDERLINE]recovery images[NOUNDERLINE] loaded in developer mode will not check if their [UNDERLINE]kernver[NOUNDERLINE] is lower than that of the system)
