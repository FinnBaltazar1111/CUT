<h3>An explination of the ChromeOS boot system from CPU init to kernel loading</h3>
</header>
<main>

<div class='section'>Section 1 - Overview</div>

When a Chromebook boots up, the first action performed depends on which security software is being utilized. <div class='red'>If a
TI50 is used, the <div class='underline'>GSC</div>, before <div class='underline'>AP</div> load, will verify the RO
<div class='underline'>AP</div> if <div class='underline'>FWMP<div class='underline'> is set. If this verification fails, the GSC will hold the EC
in reset, effectively bricking the system, requiring a <div class='underline'>SuzyQ</div> or external EEPROM flasher like a
CH341A to recover.</div> For unknown reasons, this check only seems to run on GSC reset, which only occurs if the
system completely looses power.

If the system uses another security chip (or the RO <div class='underline'>AP</div> verification passes/doesn't run), the
CPU will load the code from the AP and execute it. From here, the AP loads Coreboot, which handles hardware
initialization before chainloading <div class='underline'>VBoot</div>. <div class='underline'>VBoot</div> first checks if the
<div class='underline'>Recovery</div> switch is set and continues accordingly.  Continuing in normal boot, it verifies the
RW region of the firmware[1], then, if it's valid, it continues on to loading the region. RW then checks if the
<div class='underline'>Developer</div> switch is set; if it is, then it continues on to <div class='underline'>Developer</div>,
otherwise it continues to <div class='underline'>Verified</div>.

<div class='section'>Section 2 - Boot modes</div>

- <div class='subsection'>Verified</div>

1. Find all ChromeOS kernel partitions
2. Sort them by kernel priority
3. Check the first kernel's signing against the public key
4. Compares the kernel's kernver with the GSC's 5. Loads <div class='underline'>Depthcharge</div> pointing at the kernel's
partition

If steps 3 or 4 fail, it cascades verification attempts in order of priority until either the end of the list is
reached or a kernel can be loaded.

- <div class='subsection'>Recovery</div>

Waits until a USB drive is inserted, then verifies the kernel on the USB against the signing key stored in the RO;
if the key matches, the AP loads Depthcharge pointing at the kernel on the USB. The firmware does not compare the
kernvers. If recovery is triggered while <div class='underline'>Developer</div> mode is active, the
<div class='underline'>FWMP</div>, <div class='underline'>KERNVER</div>, and TPM_FWVER regions are protected from writes[1].
Contrary to popular belief, <div class='bold'>RMA Shims don't have a special underlying signing key</div>. The AP actually
does something quite strange here, as, while the underlying signing key is the same, the key actually used to sign
the shim also contains a configuration option that specifies it as a shim.

- <div class='subsection'>Developer</div>

Upon loading, <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> status is checked; if it's set, the firmware will refuse to load any
other payloads and will show debugging information. There are 3 payload options from here:
- (CTRL+U) Depthcharge (SSD): Loads Depthcharge pointing at the internal storage, skipping the validity check
(unless dev_boot_signed_only=1)
- (CTRL+D) Depthcharge (USB): Ditto, but with Depthcharge pointing at the USB controller
- (CTRL+L) RW_Legacy: Jumps to the start of the RW_Legacy coreboot filesystem (Mr. Chromebox's FW_Legacy script
modifies this)

[1] - This protection was added in CR50 update <UNKNOWN>, shipped on ChromeOS v111 and higher
