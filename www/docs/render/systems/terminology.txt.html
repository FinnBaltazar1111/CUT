<h3>A guide to common ChromeOS hacking systems and terminology</h3>
</header>
<main>
<div class='section'>Section 1 - Basic systems</div>

<div class='subsection'>Partition</div>

A disk is separated into multiple parts, or partitions; each one usually contains a filesystem, but not always

<div class='subsection'>AP</div> (Application Processor)

The AP is the chip that stores the firmware, typically <div class='underline'>Coreboot</div>.
- Loads and bootstraps the ChromeOS system
- Separated into read-only (RO) and read-write (RW) sections; the GSC protects the RO section from being written to
unless the <div class='underline'>Hardware WP</div> is disabled
- The code on the chip and the chip itself are often reffered to interchangably as "AP"
- On CR50 boards, the write-protection on the RO region cannot be disabled without hardware modification or
<div class='underline'>CCD</div> (see <div class='underline'>Titan-C vs CR50 vs TI50</div>)

<div class='subsection'>Coreboot</div>

Coreboot is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) firmware platform that handles hardware initialization and executes specific
payload; in the case of Chromebooks, this payload is almost always <div class='underline'>VBoot</div>.

<div class='subsection'>VBoot</div> (Verified Boot)

Coreboot payload that handles ChromeOS intial security checks and kernel loading.

<div class='subsection'>Depthcharge</div>

ChromeOS' bootloader
- Stored in the RO firmware
- Verifies and loads ChromeOS kernel images according to the configuration given and options passed.
- The configuration in question is stored in an unknown format[1] on the kernel's partition.

<div class='subsection'>Rootfs</div>

- The actual system of ChromeOS; stores all executed programs
- Read-only
- Verified on boot by the <div class='underline'>GSC</div>
- 2 partitions for ChromeOS' update scheme ROOT A is in use most of the time, but when the device updates, the update
is written to ROOT B. When the device next restarts, it loads ROOT B, which then updates ROOT A This is all to
facilitate a fairly seamless update experience, as well as providing failsafes.

<div class='subsection'>Verified mode</div>

Also known as normal boot mode
- Depthcharge verifies all kernels loaded
- If a kernel (or the <div class='underline'>rootfs</div> that kernel loads) fails verification, this mode displays the
"ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen

<div class='subsection'>Recovery mode</div>

- Used to restore critical ChromeOS system files in the event that a system becomes unbootable
- In normal (verified) boot mode, <div class='underline'>recovery images</div> will fail on the verification step if their
kernver is lower than the system's
- Utilizes a chain of trust starting with <div class='underline'>Depthcharge</div> verifying the
<div class='underline'>Kernel</div>, which then verifies the in-built <div class='underline'>ROOTFS </div>

<div class='subsection'>Developer mode</div>

- Permits booting of unsigned operating systems, taking TPM ownership, and writing to the
<div class='underline'>firmware</div>
- If <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is set, this can only load recovery media FWMP being set is also known as "fake dev
mode" (although this is a misnomer, see <div class='underline'>FWMP</div>) Throughout this guide, dev mode is assumed to
mean that <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is enabled, while NOFWMP dev mode means the opposite

<div class='subsection'>Recovery image</div> (TODO)

<div class='subsection'>Stateful</div>

- Stores the <div class='underline'>Encstateful</div>
- Largest partition on the disk
- Stores various OS info

<div class='subsection'>VPD</div> (Vital Product Data)

- Stored in the RO section of the <div class='underline'>Firmware</div>
- Stores data that uniquely identifies a device, as well as some flags such as block_devmode (note: these work in
conjunction with FWMP)
- Contains the serial number, MAC address, and

<div class='subsection'>CCD</div> (Closed-Case Debug)

A set of developer tools that can be utilized when <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is not set, permitting various actions
that would normally require hardware modification by using a specific USB-C cable. The main features are permitting
for disabling <div class='underline'>AP</div> RO WP and updating the RW region of the CR50.

<div class='section'>Section 2 - Security systems</div>

<div class='subsection'>FWMP</div> (Firmware Management Parameters)

- For the purposes of this documentation, <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> refers specifically to the block_devmode flag
being set, as that's what almost everyone means when they say "FWMP is set"
- Stored on the TPM
- Dictates whether <div class='underline'>NOFWMP dev mode</div> can be loaded
- Cannot be set while booted in <div class='underline'>Recovery mode</div> while <div class='underline'>Developer mode</div> is
enabled; aka RMA shims

<div class='subsection'>Kenver</div>

Also known as kernel version
- Google's response to downgrading
- Depthcharge refuses to load any ChromeOS kernel in <div class='underline'>Verified boot mode</div> unless the
DISABLE_FW_ROLLBACK_CHECK <div class='underline'>GBB</div> flag is set.

<div class='subsection'>Encstateful</div> (encrypted stateful)

- Main storage partition; any user-edited files are stored here
- Stores enrollment information

<div class='subsection'>GSC</div> (Google Security Chip)

AKA TPM; chip on the motherboard that runs the CR50/TI48/TI50 software stack
- Stores <div class='underline'>FWMP</div>
- Stores the decryption key for the <div class='underline'>Encstateful</div>
- Wiped on entering and exiting <div class='underline'>Developer mode</div>
- Set to read-only when booting while booting <div class='underline'>Recovery mode</div> while <div class='underline'>Developer
mode</div> is enabled This applies to booting <div class='underline'>RMA shims</div>, as well as unverified
recovery images (as <div class='underline'>recovery images</div> loaded in developer mode will not check if their
<div class='underline'>kernver</div> is lower than that of the system)
- Controls OS access to the <div class='underline'>Firmware</div>

<div class='subsection'>Hardware WP</div>

A hardware condition that tells the <div class='underline'>GSC</div> to disallow writes to the RO
<div class='underline'>Firmware</div> If <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is set, this condition is ignored and the RO firmware
is protected regardless Depending on the device, this can be disabled by:
- Unscrewing a specific screw on the motherboard
- Unplugging the battery
- Bridging 2 pins on the motherboard See <a href='https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html'>https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/firmware/wp/disabling.html</a> for more info
