<h3>A guide to common ChromeOS hacking systems and terminology</h3>
</header>
<main>
<div class='section'>Section 1 - Basic systems</div>

- <div class='subsection'>Partition</div>
A disk is separated into multiple parts, or partitions; each one usually contains a filesystem, but not always

- <div class='subsection'>Firmware</div>
- First code run by the AP (commonly known as the CPU)
- Loads and bootstraps the ChromeOS system

- <div class='subsection'>FWMP</div> (Firmware Management Parameters)
- For the purposes of this documentation, <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> refers specifically to the
block_devmode flag being set, as that's what almost everyone means when they say "FWMP is set"
- Stored on the TPM
- Dictates whether <div class='underline'>NOFWMP dev mode</div> can be loaded
- Cannot be set while booted in <div class='underline'>Recovery mode</div> while <div class='underline'>Developer mode</div> is enabled; aka RMA shims

- <div class='subsection'>Rootfs</div>
- The actual system of ChromeOS; stores all executed programs
- Read-only
- Verified on boot by the <div class='underline'>GSC</div>
- 2 partitions for ChromeOS' update scheme
ROOT A is in use most of the time, but when the device updates, the update is written to ROOT B.
When the device next restarts, it loads ROOT B, which then updates ROOT A
This is all to facilitate a fairly seamless update experience, as well as providing failsafes

- <div class='subsection'>Verified mode</div>
Also known as normal boot mode
- Depthcharge verifies all kernels loaded
- If a kernel (or the <div class='underline'>rootfs</div> that kernel loads) fails verification, this mode displays the "ChromeOS is missing or damaged" screen

- <div class='subsection'>Recovery mode</div>
- Used to restore critical ChromeOS system files in the event that a system becomes unbootable
- In normal (verified) boot mode, <div class='underline'>recovery images</div> will fail on the verification step if their kernver is lower than the system's
- Utilizes a chain of trust starting with <div class='underline'>Depthcharge</div> verifying the <div class='underline'>Kernel</div>, which then verifies the in-built <div class='underline'>ROOTFS </div>

- <div class='subsection'>Developer mode</div>
- Permits booting of unsigned operating systems, taking TPM ownership, and writing to the <div class='underline'>firmware</div>
- If <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is set, this can only load recovery media
FWMP being set is also known as "fake dev mode" (although this is a misnomer, see <div class='underline'>FWMP</div>)
Throughout this guide, dev mode is assumed to mean that <div class='underline'>FWMP</div> is enabled, while NOFWMP dev mode means the opposite

- <div class='subsection'>Recovery image</div> (TODO)

- <div class='subsection'>Kenver</div>
Also known as kernel version
- Google's response to downgrading
- Depthcharge refuses to load any ChromeOS kernel in <div class='underline'>Verified boot mode</div> unless the DISABLE_FW_ROLLBACK_CHECK <div class='underline'>GBB</div> flag is set.

- <div class='subsection'>Stateful</div>
- Stores the <div class='underline'>Encstateful</div>
- Largest partition on the disk
- Stores various OS info

- <div class='subsection'>Encstateful</div> (encrypted stateful)
- Main storage partition; any user-edited files are stored here
- Stores enrollment information

- <div class='subsection'>GSC</div> (Google Security Chip)
AKA CR50/TI48/TI50 or TPM
- Performs <div class='underline'>Kernel</div> verification
- Stores <div class='underline'>FWMP</div>
- Stores the decryption key for the <div class='underline'>Encstateful</div>
- Wiped on entering and exiting <div class='underline'>Developer mode</div>
- Set to read-only when booting while booting <div class='underline'>Recovery mode</div> while <div class='underline'>Developer mode</div> is enabled
This applies to booting <div class='underline'>RMA shims</div>, as well as unverified recovery images
(as <div class='underline'>recovery images</div> loaded in developer mode will not check if their <div class='underline'>kernver</div> is lower than that of the system)
